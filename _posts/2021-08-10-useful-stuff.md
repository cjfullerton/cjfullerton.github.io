This post contains a rolling list of tools I've found useful while developing research software over the years.

# macOS
- **iTerm2:** I work mostly through the terminal, and I've found [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) to be an invaluable replacement
for macOS's default terminal.

# BASH
- **Vim**
- **tmux**
- **gnuplot**

# MATLAB
- **MATLAB Schemer:** My main project has been written using MATLAB. I write my code in Vim, but I use the MATLAB IDE
for debugging. The excellent [MATLAB schemer](https://github.com/scottclowe/matlab-schemer) allows you to quickly set
different colourschemes, making MATLAB's IDE much easier on the eye.
