I had completely forgotten about this site.
I figured it would be a good place to collect together information I've found useful as part of my job.
For example, how exactly did I install Windows Subsystem for Linux and get it working the way I wanted?
Or what vim plugins have been worth using?

I'm hoping that this will stop me having to trawl through my bulging bookmarks folder and browser history looking for
the set of instructions I'm after, and that it will be some good writing practice.
