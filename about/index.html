	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I am a postdoctoral researcher in theoretical and computational statistical physics. I am interested in systems which display interesting collective phenomena, 
	particularly glasses and systems undergoing self assembly. Most recently I have been using the swap Monte Carlo algorithm to explore glassy systems at temperatures
	and densities where it would not normally be possible to equilibrate them.</p>
	<p>I currently work in the <a href="https://www.coulomb.univ-montp2.fr/?lang=fr">Laboratoire Charles Coulomb</a> at the Universit&eacute de Montpellier in France.
	I previously worked in the Condensed Matter Theory group at the University of Bath and before that I completed a PhD at the University of Manchester.</p>
