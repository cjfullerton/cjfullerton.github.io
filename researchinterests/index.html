	<h2>Ultrastable glasses and the swap algorithm</h2>
	<p>The swap algorithm makes it possible to equilibrate simulated glasses at high packing fractions and low temperatures where it was previously 
	impossible. Having equilibrated a glass at in this previously impossible to reach region, the difficulty is now studying it effectively. To make observations
	of the 'real' behaviour of the system, regular simulations (without swap moves) must be used and the slow dynamics returns. Thus some kind of 'destructive'
	testing is employed - compressing the glass further to search for a Gardner transition, shearing it until it breaks or (in my case) melting it.</p>
	<h2>Glasses with unusually slow dynamics (transition path sampling)</h2>
	<p>More to come!</p>
	<h2>Optimising self assembly</h2>
	<p>More to come!</p>
	<h2>Gelation</h2>
	<p>More to come!</p>
